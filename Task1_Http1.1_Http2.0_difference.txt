Question:
--------
Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

Answer:
-------
HTTP 1.1:
========
1. Key Features
        It supports connection reuse i.e. for every TCP connection there could be multiple requests and responses, and pipelining where the client can request several resources from the server at once. However, pipelining was hard to implement due to issues such as head-of-line blocking and was not a feasible solution.

2. Status Code	
         Introduces a warning header field to carry additional information about the status of a message. Can define 24 status codes, error reporting is quicker and more efficient.
        
3. Authentication Mechanism
         It is relatively secure since it uses digest authentication, NTLM authentication

4. Caching
         Expands on the caching support by using additional headers like cache-control, conditional headers like If-Match and by using entity tags.

5. Web Traffic
         HTTP/1.1 provides faster delivery of web pages and reduces web traffic as compared to HTTP/1.0. However, TCP starts slowly and with domain sharding

HTTP 2.0:
========
1. Key Features	
        Uses multiplexing, where over a single TCP connection resources to be delivered are interleaved and arrive at the client almost at the same time. It is done using streams which can be prioritized, can have dependencies and individual flow control. It also provides a feature called server push that allows the server to send data that the client will need but has not yet requested.

2. Status cose
        Underlying semantics of HTTP such as headers, status codes remains the same.

3. Authentication Mechanism
        Security concerns from previous versions will continue to be seen in HTTP/2. However, it is better equipped to deal with them due to new TLS features like connection error of type Inadequate_Security.

4. Caching
        HTTP/2 does not change much in terms of caching. With the server push feature if the client finds the resources are already present in the cache, it can cancel the pushed stream.

5. Web Traffic
       HTTP/2 utilizes multiplexing and server push to effectively reduce the page load time by a greater margin along with being less sensitive to network delays.
